Several smaller programs that provided education benefits to Servicemembers and Veterans before the Post-9/11 GI Bill still exist to help previous generations of Veterans, as well as Guardsmen and Reservists not eligible for the new GI Bill. [An accredited representative](/disability-benefits/apply-for-benefits/help/index.html) working for a veterans service organization and the [GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/) can help you pick the right program for you.
